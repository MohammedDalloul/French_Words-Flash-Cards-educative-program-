# French_Words-Flash-Cards-educative-program-
A flash cards program for learning French Words

A program to help Beginner French learners test their memorization for the meanings of common french words.
The program generates on the 100 most common French words {stated by the Wikipedia French documentation} in a CSV-file with their meanings in English.
The program, when run, shows a card that contains the French word and the user has to guess its meaning in 3 seconds where after 3 seconds the card is 
going to automatically flip to show the English meaning of the word.
>> We have two buttons : 
    1. Right button : when pressed it means that the user knew the word and guessed right so that it is automatically dropped from the words file for the
                          next of the attemot.
    2. Wrong button : when pressed it means that the user couldn't guess the word right and so that it is copied to a CSV-file that contains the words to 
                      learn so tah that it keeps generating these words along the game ...etc.
